# Mpesa_Statement_Analysis
So I started working on it around the first weeks of December 2022, definitely started with a lot of expectations. Thought this would be like a one week project and I‚Äôd be done, but life hit me with the, ‚ÄúYou thought I was feeling you? ha!‚Äù Second week of December we had a class trip to Msa and final year project presentations, Third week, we had our final exams and well 4th week is Christmas.

So I started the project again this January, around 3rd, but you know I just finished school, I was super focused on landing a job by the end of January. Life still hitting me with the, you thought I was feeling youüòÇüòÇ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. anyway, I got back to the project. I gave up on the 5th! ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I bet that‚Äôs your question. 


### **Data Cleaning**

Well you see our mpesa transactions are saved as they are. Not in a way that saves you the job of data cleaning. Imagine going through 9876 rows of data, one row at a time with your mpesa statement next to it, trying to imagine what exactly you were paying for in that Till Number! Those were the struggles. I‚Äôd find myself paying over 800 bob to a till number but no record of what I was paying for!!!!!!!! How do I keep track of my expenses without the proof of what you were purchasing. So I gave up. I wasn‚Äôt going to clean all those rows on my own. Who me! Never!

Well I did clean the 9876 rows, I sat down everyday for 30 minutes right before bed, opened my original mpesa statement, opened the 2022 calender, went through my chats with friends to try and find if I said something to them about going shopping, or going out. Good thing about me, I have a box of most of the receipts I get after shopping, it helps me keep count of my reward points. 10 days later, I was done with renaming the rows, Lemme show you a sneak peek:

I took it from this;

### **Working on the Data**

After cleaning, well I had the statement in the format that I wanted. It‚Äôs like finishing the dirty job of cleaning squids but now you‚Äôre done and can easily cook them in accordance to your recipe. Onto the next task, well I didn‚Äôt need the time column honestly. So I dropped it. That was actually the 1st and only thing I dropped on the entire dataset. Safaricom‚Äôs data team is doing a good job keeping their data quite easy to work with. Next step, extracting months from the date column. That‚Äôs an easy task right! After that I just had to do some analysis on the data, if you notice the workbook names at the bottom of my excel screenshots, well you can see the kind of work I did.
By 20th of January, I had calculated my monthly expenses, income, read a lot of money books about what situation 21-year old me is in, financially. Back to the interesting stuff, 21 pivot tables later, I actually stayed working on the dashboard, but‚Ä¶.. it just didn‚Äôt click to me. The plots, analysis, tables, all of that was okay I just didn‚Äôt like the design. Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong... this is what it looked like.

### **Dashboard Template**

Let‚Äôs be honest, for your 1st Data analysis project, wouldn‚Äôt you want to make a statement. Go big or go home, right! So I took a break from excel and went to the magical place we call the internet. A couple of templates later, I found one that stood out to me‚Ä¶ and I worked with it. Call it a coincidence or luck but the template actually had a tutorial for how the shapes would be collected to form one huge palate that is basically the whole design.

So I woke up super happy on the 22nd, opened a new excel workbook and started working on the design of the dashboard. Took me 3 hours to get everything in order, compare what I wanted my dashboard to look like against the template I used as inspiration. 6 days later, I was done. And this is the final result;
When you open the notebook this is what meets your eyes

The actual work was done here, oh btw, I shaded the money spent on my expenses cause I'm not ready to reveal how bankrupt I am. This was my favorite page, I uploaded some of my understandings from the book, "Psychology of Money"

Finally, the last page, covers how different I aim to be in 2023. What are my goals and most importantly, can I be able to afford a Z Flip Phone?

### **The end**
Enough story telling, I know you're probably wondering, why did it take me a month to do all this, well as I said when I started the story, I had goals for the month of January and I had to try and achieve these goals. However, I tried my best to dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to this project. So I voluntereed 30 minutes from the 3rd - 28th of January. That's a total of 780 minutes which is an equivalent of 13 hours. And if you look at it that way, then it only took me half a day to analyze my financial statement.
