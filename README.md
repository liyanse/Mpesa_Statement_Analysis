# Mpesa_Statement_Analysis
Okay so I am using a service provider known as Safaricom, and one of their main services is to offer money transactions. So for 2022, I ensured most of my transactions were made through my primary number so I could track my earnings and expenses. That is basically when I thought about this project.

Started working on it around the first weeks of December 2022, definitely started with a lot of expectations. Thought this would be like a one week project and I‚Äôd be done, but life hit me with the, ‚ÄúYou thought I was feeling you? ha!‚Äù Second week of December we had a class trip to Msa and final year project presentations, Third week, we had our final exams and well 4th week is Christmas.

So I started the project again this January, around 3rd, but you know I just finished school, I was super focused on landing a job by the end of January. Life still hitting me with the, you thought I was feeling youüòÇüòÇ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. anyway, I got back to the project. I gave up on the 5th! ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I bet that‚Äôs your question. 

Well you see our mpesa transactions are saved as they are. Not in a way that saves you the job of data cleaning. Imagine going through 9876 rows of data, one row at a time with your mpesa statement next to it, trying to imagine what exactly you were paying for in that Till Number! Those were the struggles. I‚Äôd find myself paying over 800 bob to a till number but no record of what I was paying for!!!!!!!! How do I keep track of my expenses without the proof of what you were purchasing. So I gave up. I wasn‚Äôt going to clean all those rows on my own. Who me! Never!

Well I did clean the 9876 rows, I sat down everyday for 30 minutes right before bed, opened my original mpesa statement, opened the 2022 calender, went through my chats with friends to try and find if I said something to them about going shopping, or going out. Good thing about me, I have a box of most of the receipts I get after shopping, it helps me keep count of my reward points. 10 days later, I was done with renaming the rows, Lemme show you a sneak peek:

I took it from this;
